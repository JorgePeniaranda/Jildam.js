<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://www.google.com)

Jildam is a password management application with a focus on customizing the user experience. In addition to allowing you to manage and generate passwords securely, it also offers the possibility of customizing your profile with information such as your name, surname, biography, and profile picture, like in a forum.

The application is developed using React and utilizes Tailwind CSS for the user interface, ensuring a modern and appealing design. React, an open-source JavaScript library, simplifies the creation of interactive and dynamic user interfaces. On the other hand, Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable CSS framework that enables agile and stylized design.
